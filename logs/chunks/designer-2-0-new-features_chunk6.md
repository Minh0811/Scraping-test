### Canvas Resize Options

We have added Landscape and Portrait options to the Resizing option for greater ease of use. This allows you to reshape your canvas and design with a click of a button. Made the design in landscape but you need it for a screen in portrait mode? No worries!

* Select **Resize**from the tool bar
* Deselect **Maintain Aspect Ratio**
* Select **Portrait** or **Landscape**
