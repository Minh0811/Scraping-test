### Background Remover

Automatically detects and removes backgrounds from images. It currently only supports auto-removal and at present it is not possible to custom erase or restore the background.

To remove the background:

* Select **Background Remover** from the tool bar
* Wait for the **loading icon** to finish
* Click **Save**

Â Afterwards, it will simply disappear!
