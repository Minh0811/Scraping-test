### HDMI & TV Connection Troubleshooting

If you’re having problems connecting your Android Player to your HDMI port or TV, here are some steps to try:

* Try a different HDMI port on your screen
* Try to connect the Android Player directly to your TV without the HDMI extended
* Try a different TV or monitor to see if it will work at all

If none of these work, contact our support team at [support@optisigns.com](mailto:support@optisigns.com).
