Creating an Attract Screen
--------------------------

First, you'll want to navigate to the [**Engage Management**](https://app.optisigns.com/app/engageManagement) page.

Select either **New App** or **Touch Screen** Kiosks → **Touch Screen Kiosks** → Click **Select App**

Select **Kiosk Designer** **Pro** → Click **Build**

You'll then be taken to our Designer Pro!

In Designer Pro, select **Widgets** → **Video** → **Select your video** from your asset library

Click on your video element → Click **Format Options** from the top menu bar

A **Format Options menu** will appear on the right side of the screen → Open **Position** → Click **"Use as Background"**

Your video will now become the background on Canvas and you can layer interactive elements over it!
