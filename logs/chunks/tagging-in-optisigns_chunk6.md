### Multi Asset Tagging

The most useful way to apply tags to large numbers of assets at once is by multi tagging. This is similar to applying tags to a single asset, except it can be used to apply the tag(s) to numerous assets at once.

In order to do this, you’ll need to click the Circle icon in the upper left corner of the assets you want to tag.

Clicking within the Tags field will bring up a list of existing tags that you can select from. You can also input a new tag here to create it.
