### Power Troubleshooting

One of the most common causes of device instability is not using the provided power adapters and cables.

If your device has any sort of intermittent power issues, ***please ensure it is not being powered by the USB port on your screen***. The USB port does not provide enough power to the device to keep it running under all conditions.

In the event there is no available power outlet nearby and the USB port is your only option, keep your content load light - meaning, no videos, no large files, etc.
