### Left-Aligned Side Menu

The biggest change for users will be the look and placement of functions in Designer 2.0. The new version streamlines the design, left-aligning a lot of the previous buttons and functions.

Most functions are now relocated to the left-hand side.

The left side menu will also replace the pop-up window that was utilized for certain functions.

The functions now in the left side menu include:

* Position
* Layers, formerly called “Objects”
* Data Sources
* Animation
* Widget format options
* Settings
* Text
* And more

For example, Animations controls will now appear in the left side menu.
