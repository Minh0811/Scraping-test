### Google Font Weights Support

We now have full font weight options for our Google Fonts (for example, Thin, Light, Regular, Bold).

Note: This is only available for Google Fonts.

To change the font weight:

* **Select** the text you would like to change or add a text box
* **Click** the font name on the tool bar
* **Choose** a font from the left side menu

If the font you choose is a Google font, the options will drop down underneath the font name.
