### How to Force an OTA Update

If your device misses its update window, either due to being powered off, or lacking reliable network connection, it is possible to check for an OTA update to the OptiSigns Pro Player and apply it.

In order to do this, you’ll need access to the OptiSigns Portal. From the **Screens tab**, click the **3 Dots** **→ Execute Remote Commands**.
