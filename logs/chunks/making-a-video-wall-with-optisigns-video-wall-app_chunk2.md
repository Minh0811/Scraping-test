Purchasing a Video Wall Add-On
------------------------------

In order to use the Video Wall app, you’ll need to buy a Video Wall add-on license. Each license works with a single OptiSigns Pro Player and costs $25/monthy/device.

There are two ways to purchase a license.

The first is to navigate to your **Subscription Plan** tab:

![subscription plan tab location in optisigns web browser](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/33382537873043)

Once there, scroll down to the **Video Wall Add-on** section and choose **Add Screen:**

![video wall add-on section in subscription plan tab with arrow pointing toward Add Screen button](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/33382521775379)

You’ll be prompted to add this add-on to your subscription.

The second way is to pair your subscription directly with your screen. To do this, you’ll need to hook up your OptiSigns Pro Player to at least two screens.

Now, set up your screen through the **Edit Screen** option:

![screens tab in optisigns with arrow pointing toward Edit Screen button](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/33382521787283)

![edit screen menu in optisigns web browser with arrow pointing toward Advanced button](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/33382521789203)

Navigate to **Advanced → More**, then find the **Video Wall** option and hit **Activate**:

![edit screen menu in optisigns scrolled down with arrow pointing at More button and another arrow pointed at Video Wall activate button](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/33382537889939)

You’ll be prompted to add this add-on to your subscription.
