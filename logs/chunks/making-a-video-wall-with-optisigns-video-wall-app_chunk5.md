When setting up a video wall using a ProMax player, begin with the HDMI outlets and go from left to right. **HD-A-1** will correspond to screen 1, **HD-A-2** will correspond to screen 2, **HD-A-3** will correspond to screen 3. Then the **DP** port will correspond to screen 4. If using three screens, the DP port is not needed; if using two, then the DP and HD-A-3 ports are not needed.

Remember: in most setups, the player will be facing outward, with the AV ports facing toward the screens.
