A scanning window will appear and quickly connect to your device, then you'll be taken to the remote interface.

We recommend using this method as it is the fastest and easiest way to connect and use the remote control feature on your OptiSigns Admin Mobile app. However, please note that this option is available only if the screen is already paired with your account.
