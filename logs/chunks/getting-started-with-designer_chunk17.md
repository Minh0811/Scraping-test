### Undo/Redo

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42282228332691)

The **Undo** option does what it says on the tin - it undoes the last action. If this button is pushed in error, the **Redo** button will fix it.

| **NOTE** |
| The Undo command can also be performed using **CTRL+Z** on a Windows machine or **Cmd+Z** on a Mac. Redo can be performed using **CTRL+Y** on Windows or **Cmd+SHIFT+Z** on Mac. |
