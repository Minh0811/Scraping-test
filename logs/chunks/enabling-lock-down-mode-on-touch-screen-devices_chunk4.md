***Recommended Device***

When using an OptiSigns Android Stick, the OptiSigns app is:

* **Completely Locked Down:** Users can only interact with the content being displayed on the screen.
* **Side Menu Inaccessible:** Users cannot open the OptiSigns side menu, exit the app, unpair the screen, or mess with the device

Due to OS-level control with the OptiSigns Android Stick, this method provides the most cohesive lock down.
