### History

This new feature allows you to track all your most recent changes to your design.

Careful! Clicking on a previous “event” and starting to make changes to your design will erase any events  created after that specific event.

To access History:

* Select the **layered icon** on the right side
* OR select **Position** button from the t0ol bar
* **History** is the right option that will pop up in the side menu
* **Click** any event to move to that point in your editing
