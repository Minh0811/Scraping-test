### Using the Device Log

There are two ways to use the **Device Log** feature:

1. By plugging in an external device to the player, then hitting the **Device Log** button on the **About** menu. This will bring up a box letting you know the log has been exported to the external device:

2. By using the ***collectDeviceLog*** [**Remote Command**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408658251027-How-to-use-Remote-Command-Execution-Windows-Linux) from the OptiSigns portal. This will provide a download link that you can use to obtain the log:

This can be extremely helpful for troubleshooting any issues that might have occurred when the device was not being closely monitored.
