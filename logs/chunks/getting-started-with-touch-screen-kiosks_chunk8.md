### Option 3: Directly Assigning Content to a Screen

This option will be necessary should you choose **"Save"** or **"Assign Later"** after setting up the kiosk design, and can be done with any type of kiosk design.

If you want to push your kiosk design to a screen, you'll need to find it under the **Engage** tab. Hover over it and you should see three dots. Click on this, and you'll see the **"Push to Screens"** option.

Once there, you'll see these options:

* **Asset** - The name of your asset.
* **Target -** Here, select between Screens, Tags, and Tag Rules. To better understand Tags and Tag Rules, read [this article.](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/20879903340947-How-to-Use-Content-Tags-in-The-Playlist)
* **Screens / Tags / Tag Rule** - Select which screen, tag, or tag rule will be associated with the Kiosk. This determines where your content will appear.

Once these are input, you have a few other options:

* **Temp Takeover** - Allows the Kiosk interface to temporarily take over the selected screen. You can select from several predetermined time frames, or create your own.
* **Schedule Changes** - Allows you to schedule when the kiosk interface goes live and appears onscreen.
* **Push** - Immediately push your kiosk interface to the screen, for an indeterminate amount of time.

You'll also be able to Preview your screen before you push it live.
