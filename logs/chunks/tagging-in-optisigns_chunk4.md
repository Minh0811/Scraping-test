### Tagging for Remote Commands

Screen tags can also be used by OptiSigns Remote Commands to send direct commands to multiple screens at a time. This can be anything from forcing an update to changing the content displaying on screen.

Asset Tagging
-------------

Tagging assets can be extremely helpful when you have many screens across many locations and when certain content does not apply to all screens.

For example, let’s say you want to advertise certain special deals in one location, but not another. This asset can be tagged with a simple “location” marker, which will signal where it should be displayed. You can apply as many tags as you like to a single asset.

Tags may only be applied to existing assets in OptiSigns. To learn how to create an asset, see our article on [**How to Upload and Manage Files and Assets**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016247974-How-to-Upload-Manage-Your-Files-Assets)**.**

Once there is an asset to tag, from within the **Files/Assets** tab on the OptiSigns portal, there are two methods to add/edit tags:

1. Single asset
2. Multiple (bulk) assets
