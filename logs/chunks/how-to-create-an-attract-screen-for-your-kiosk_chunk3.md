### Linking An Element

For this example, we created a "Tap Here to Begin" button using shapes and texts available in Designer.

Once the element is created, select the element you'd like to be interactive→ Click **Link** → Click "**Add Link"** from the menu on the right.

You can link this element to a **Website URL** or to **an asset** within your asset library.

| If you have more than 4 interactive/linked elements on a single page, you may run into performance issues. |

Once you've selected your desired link, you adjust your **"Link** **Options"** in the right menu

* **Scale:** Adjust how the linked element will fit to your screen when pushed
* **Duration:** This is the maximum duration the asset will display on the screen before returning to the original source it is linked from.
  + **Preload:** This will preload the asset before being clicked. Select this for a smoother kiosk experience.
* **Close** **& Nav Bar Styler:** Customize the navigation bar and close icon to better fit your design.
  + **Icon Position:** Adjust where you'd like the icons to be on your screen.
  + **Icon Style:** Adjust the visual style of the home icon.
  + **Icon** **Color:** Adjust the color of the icon and nav bar elements.
  + **Background Color:** Adjust the background color that exists behind the icons.
  + **Opacity:** This adjusts the visibility of the background color, *not* the icons.
  + **Icon Size:** Adjust how big or small you'd like the icon and nav bar to appear on your screen.
  + **Show Navigation Bar:** This will add a "Back" and "Forward" button next to the home icon.

| It is highly recommended to turn on the navigation bar for better performance on your device, especially if your kiosk has multiple pages. |

Name your design → Click **Save** → **Push to Screens**
