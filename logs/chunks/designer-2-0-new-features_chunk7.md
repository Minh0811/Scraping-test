### Reusable Component Library

This feature allows you to save any design element or grouped elements to a component library. Save any element you like and create a library of branded or themed elements, or simply one that you wanted to save for later!

To add the component:

* Click on **the element** you would like to save
* Select **More**
* Select **Add Component**

To access the components:

* Click on **Your Temp** from the left side bar
* Click on **Components**

You will now be able to add to any design!

This works with elements or designs you create, whole templates from our library, or single elements from a template.
