### Remote Control Troubleshooting

The OptiSigns Android Player ships with a Remote Control. Which remote control you have depends on the version of your player, but they largely function the same with a few slight differences.

**Gen 3 Remote:**

OptiSigns Players also support the [**Mobile Admin App**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/30003143806099-How-to-Use-the-OptiSigns-Mobile-Admin-App) as a Remote Control. This is our ***top recommendation,*** as not only does it function as a true remote control (allowing you to control your players from anywhere), but it has numerous other features as well.

If your remote control is having issues:

* Ensure batteries have been installed inside your remote control, and that they are not dead
* Re-pair your remote control with the player
* Try a plug-in USB keyboard or mouse
* Use the Mobile Admin app to set up Wi-Fi, or as a remote control itself
