### Controlling Remote Commands Received by Players

In some cases, you may not want some of your devices to be controlled remotely for any reason. The ability to receive remote commands can be toggled on the device.

Go to the side menu on the OptiSigns player, click **Advanced Options**, and you'll find the toggle for **Execute Remote Commands**. Toggling this off will cause the device to reject remote commands.
