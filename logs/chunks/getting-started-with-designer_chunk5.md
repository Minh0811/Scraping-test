Text can be chosen from either the Top Menu or the Side Menu. Either will open the Side Menu for more options:

Clicking **Add a text box** or one of the Predefined text options will add a text box to the Designer View:

Do as the prompt says, and numerous options open up to you. First, the Text itself has a full set of options:

Clicking the text also alters the Top Menu:

Double-clicking or selecting the text allows you to enter text directly.

Lastly, single clicking the text, then holding down the mouse button and dragging allows you to reposition the text.
