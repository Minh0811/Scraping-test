### Changing Device Time Zone

When **[setting a schedule](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016981853-Create-and-Using-Schedules-with-OptiSigns)**, it's critical that the portal and device share the same time zone. If the time zones are not identical, it can cause your schedule to start at a different time than you'd like. The issue is usually the device's time zone.

To do this, you'll need to change it. Start by pressing the **Home button**on your remote (or hit **Exit App** from the Side Menu), and navigate to the **Settings** menu.

![settings menu](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/41497198237971)

Select **Device Preferences**.

Select **Date & Time**.

Select **Set time zone**.

For some reason, Android devices lead with Midway Island, in the middle of the Pacific (some things in life are best left a mystery). Navigate to your preferred time zone and select it.

Now your device and schedule should sync properly.
