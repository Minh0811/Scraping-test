### Asset Tagging for Organization

Applying multiple tags to your assets will allow you to find them easier for when you need them. These tags can be anything from what type of material they are, to what the substance of the content is, to where they need to be displayed and far more.

Any time a tag is created, it is added to the list on the left of your screen in the **Files/Asset** tab:

Any of these tags are clickable. Doing so will highlight them green.

Now, this is useful on its own, as it will then only display assets which possess that tag:

Selecting multiple tags will display any assets that have any of these tags:

This can also be used inside any folder to the same effect:

These tags, essentially, provide a filter for what content will be displayed. Combining these tags with your folders makes it extremely easy to locate assets relevant to what youâ€™re looking for.

Tags can also be used to denote Expired assets (i.e. a Christmas message from last year), which makes them easy to filter out.

Currently, OptiSigns allows creation of up to 40 asset tags.
