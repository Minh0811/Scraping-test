### Internal Website and Certificates

For installation on a Gen 3 Pro or ProMax Player, your certificate must have a **.crt** extension. However, it is important that this certificate is signed and contains your public key. These are usually generated as **.pem** files. Youâ€™ll need to rename your certificate (.pem) file and change its extension to **.crt** for your internal website to properly display.
