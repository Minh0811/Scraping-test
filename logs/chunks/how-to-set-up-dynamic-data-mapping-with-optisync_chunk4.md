### How to Use Display Format Options

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/42702979620883)

If you'd like to change how the formatting of certain data from your DataSource looks on your repeater, you can do so with the Display Format option available in the Repeater Editor. This saves you time from editing your original DataSource, and will apply to the formatting to all the repeated elements in the Repeater.

**Follow the steps in the previous section regarding Property Mapping to access the Display Format options.**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Display Format Option | What It Does |
| Text | This will show raw value without formatting. |
| Date Time | You can change the time zone, date format, and time format with available options. |
| Number | You can format numbers to display as percentages, decimals, currency, and more. |
