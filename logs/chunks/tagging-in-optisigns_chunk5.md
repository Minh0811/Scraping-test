### Single Asset Tagging

Single asset tagging is quite simple: just click the **Three Dots** on the asset you wish to tag, then choose **Edit Tags** from the drop down menu:

This will open up the Edit Tags menu for this single asset:

Clicking within the Tags field will bring up a list of existing tags that you can select from. You can also input a new tag here to create it.

This feature is most useful for adding individual tags to specific assets that may be different from those around it.
