### Step 2: Mapping the API to a DataSource

We cover most of the details of this step in our [How to Set Up Dynamic Data Mapping via OptiSync](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/29217646663187-How-to-Set-Up-Dynamic-Data-Mapping-with-OptiSync). If imported correctly, your data will appear in JSON format, like this:

![json data map optisigns](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/35337756509075)

Your news stories will have similar data sets if you’re following this guide. The most important data fields are:

* “Title”
* “Description”
* “Banner Image URL”
  + Inputting this URL will display the banner image.

| You will also want to make note of the “PromotedState” data value. These will be useful for applying filters later on. Other values can also be made use of with Filters, should you so desire. |
