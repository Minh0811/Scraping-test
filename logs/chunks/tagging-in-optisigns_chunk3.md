### Tag Rules

With Tag Rules, it's possible to set a network of Tags for an Asset to display on.

For example, let's say you want an advertisement to play only in customer-facing screens, but only in certain locations. You can combine these screens into a single Tag Rule, then push content to only those screens.

To do this, select the **Target**to say **Tag Rules**on the Push to Screens tab:

Hit **New:**

This will bring up the Screen Tag Rule screen:

Here, you have the ability to **Include**or **Exclude**certain tags using and/or logic commands. You can add **Rules**or **Rulesets**to make these as elaborate as you like:

When you're ready to go, simply click on any Field and you'll be prompted to Add a tag via a dropdown menu:

Now you're ready to include or exclude any tags you'd like. When you're finished, hit **Save**.

You'll then be able to select this Tag Rule on the Push to Screens tab, and use it across your assets.
