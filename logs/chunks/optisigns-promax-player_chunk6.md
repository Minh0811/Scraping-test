After choosing SSID, you can choose security type and enter credentials. (If you choose WPA-Enterprise with TLS make sure your certificate is in .pem format)

Hereâ€™s what each field means and what you need to do:

* **WIFI SSID**: Select the name of the Wi-Fi network you want to connect to from the dropdown list.
* **WIFI Password**: Enter the password for the selected Wi-Fi network. You can click on the eye icon to show or hide the password as you type.
* **WIFI Security**: This dropdown lets you choose the type of security protocol your Wi-Fi network uses. By default, this is set to WPA2-PSK, which is the most common and secure option.

Once you have entered all the required information, click on the "**CONNECT**" button to link your OptiSigns Pro Player to the Wi-Fi network.
