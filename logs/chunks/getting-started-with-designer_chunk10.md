Clicking it opens up the **Draw** panel on the Side Menu:

Here, youâ€™ll have a few options:

* **Stop Drawing** - Keeps the Draw panel open, but allows adjustments to be made to the image. When clicked, this will change to **Start Drawing**.
* **Brush Type** - Selects which type of brush to use when drawing.
* **Brush Size** - Lets you customize the size of your brush.
* **Brush Color** - Select brush color from a set of default colors or through the color picker.

Once the options you want have been selected, you can draw whatever you like on the design:

These drawn elements can be selected and edited just like any other element of the design.
