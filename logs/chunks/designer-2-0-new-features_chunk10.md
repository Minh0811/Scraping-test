### Image Masking

Our new tool allows you to apply shapes or elements as masks to images.

* Click on the **Mask** icon from the tool bar
* Select any **shape** or search for more shapes on the left side menu

The mask and the image attach automatically when you select it.

To edit the placement on the picture, **Edit Mask** detaches the overlaid shape.

**Apply Mask** reapplies it and groups it back together.

To delete the shape altogether, select **Remove Mask**.
