### Merging Screens to Create a Continuous Image or Video

To create one continuous image, the screens will need to be merged.

To do this, click the **Merge Screens** button:

Then, select the screens you’d like to merge:

These two screens will now be merged, and considered the same Zone:

You can continue merging screens if you have a third to create a video wall that looks like the image below, with one continuous image.

In order to unmerge screens, select the merged screens, hit the **Merge Screens** button again, then hit the two arrows going out from each other:

This will separate the screens into separate Zones once again.

Once you’ve finished setting up the Video Wall app, hit **Save**. This will store it as an Asset. As an Asset, you can push it to a screen directly, add it to a Playlist, or schedule it to play at any time.

With a Video Wall license purchased and app made, it's now time to set up your video wall! To do this, simply arrange the screens in the same manner you've arranged them in the app, then plug in the appropriate HDMI or DP port.
