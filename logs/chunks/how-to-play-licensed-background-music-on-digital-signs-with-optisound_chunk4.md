### **Step 3: Connect Your Device to Your Audio System**

To play the music through your business’s sound system you can either:

* Use a **wired audio connection** (e.g., 3.5mm aux, RCA, or HDMI audio out), or
* Pair the device via **Bluetooth** to your speaker setup.

Double-check your device’s audio output settings to make sure it matches your connection type.
