Video walls are a common request from OptiSigns customers. They can be used in numerous industries, including retail, manufacturing, entertainment, command and control environments, broadcasting, education, and far more.

Now, using the power of the new [OptiSigns Pro](https://www.optisigns.com/post/the-new-optisigns-pro-digital-signage-player-is-here) and [ProMax Player](https://www.optisigns.com/product/hardware/promax-digital-signage-player) and the Video Wall App, it’s possible to push your digital signs to multiple screens and use them as a cohesive video wall easier than ever.

What’s Needed?
--------------

To set up a video wall for use in the Video Wall app, you’ll need:

* An [OptiSigns subscription](https://www.optisigns.com/pricing) - Standard Plan or Higher
* An **[OptiSigns Pro Player](https://shop.optisigns.com/products/optisigns-digital-signage-player)** or [**ProMax Player**](https://www.optisigns.com/product/hardware/promax-digital-signage-player)

| **A NOTE ON PRICING** |
| The license and Video Wall app apply to the player, not the number of screens. In other words, you will only need one license per video wall, regardless of the number of screens used.    Example: say you have a Pro Plus plan license at $15/month. You then want to make a 4-screen video wall using a ProMax Player. You buy a single Video Wall add-on. This lets you run a 4-screen video wall at $40/month. That same $40/month could be used to run a 2 or 3 screen video wall as well. |

Video Wall App Capabilities
---------------------------

With the Video Wall app, you can push content to multiple screens at once. There are a few things to keep in mind:

* The ProMax Player is our ***most recommended***option if you're looking to use a video wall with digital signage. It allows for 4K video per screen and our full range of options, with up to four screens usable in any orientation.
* The Pro Player can handle up to 3 screens at a time, at 1080p max resolution.
