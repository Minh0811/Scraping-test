#### **Limitations**

Since we lack permission on the device, we can't pin the OptiSigns app or run it in single app mode. We recommend using Android MDM software, which usually works with major hardware manufacturers and has the necessary permissions to pin the OptiSigns app.

* **Exit the App:** Users can still exit the OptiSigns app.
* **Navigation Bar is Accessible:** The device navigation bar remains accessible so users can make changes at the device level and escape the app. Steps can be taken to minimize or limit the navigation bar depending on the device.
