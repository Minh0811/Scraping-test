### Option 2: Via API

In order to pull event data from an API, follow our guide on [integrating API and publishing API data.](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/22875592994195-How-to-Integrate-API-and-Publish-API-Data-via-OptiSync)

Data can be set up in Designer in the same manner as if you were using a spreadsheet.

Setting up a Weekly Event Schedule with OptiSync
------------------------------------------------

Setting up a weekly event schedule is much the same as a daily schedule. There are numerous ways you can format your spreadsheet, but one of the easiest is like this:

Here, we’ve grouped all our events together with their location, date, and time. Depending on your needs, these may need to be input as individual rows, or individual pieces rather than as Repeaters.

Complex weekly schedules like the one above will be easiest to input individually. Selecting the **Row** and dragging it onto your Design will open the following prompt. Hit **Use on its own**.

Organizing your data this way will allow precise placement. We recommend this option when data can’t be easily repeated, as in this example where there are different numbers of events on different days.

Your spreadsheet can be updated every week, and a simple refresh will update the design on OptiSigns.

Setting up a Monthly Event Schedule with OptiSync
-------------------------------------------------

Monthly event calendars let you alert your customers or organization of upcoming events well in advance. Using Google Sheets as an example, the data can be organized in much the same way we did our weekly events. Simply add as many columns as you might want to place on your design. Remember, not every piece of data needs to be added to your final design, so you’re free to pick and choose as needed.

Importing this example data to OptiSigns will provide us with these clusters:
