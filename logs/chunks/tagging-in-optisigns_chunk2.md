The most commonly used feature of screen tagging is the ability to push content - be that an asset, playlist, or schedule - to multiple screens at once.

To do this, find the piece of content you wish to push, then click the **Three Dots**:

This will open up the Options menu. Click **Push to Screens**. You’ll see the Push to Screens tab:

Here, select the **Target** to say “Tags”:

You can then select the Tags from your previously created Screen Tags.

When done, hit **Push**. Your content will now display on any Online screens that have the tag you selected. This is a method OptiSigns uses to change what displays on numerous screens at once, and can be used to drastically speed up deployments.
