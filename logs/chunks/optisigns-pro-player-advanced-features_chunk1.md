OTA Updates
-----------

The OptiSigns Pro Player makes use of OTA updates to receive security patches, platform enhancements, additional feature support, and more.

By default, the Pro Player can be set to check for updates once per week at a time you specify. If update is available, it will be automatically downloaded as long as the player has an internet connection. It’s also possible to force an OTA update if necessary.
